   <h3>Your Laugh</h3>
    <p>Babe,

    Where do I even begin with your laugh? It is the most beautiful sound in the world to me. Every time I hear it, it fills my heart with joy and happiness.
    
    Your laugh is infectious and it makes me smile every time I hear it. It is a sound that I will never tire of, and I could listen to it for hours on end. Your laugh is a reflection of your perfect personality, and it makes me fall in love with you all over again every time I hear it.
    
    Like I will forever tell you, picking you up that day from the airport will always be one of the greatest days of my life. Everything forever changed that day, and I am so grateful for it happening.
    
    From sitting on the couch together and laughing about the crime shows we watch, to going off on wild adventures, I wouldn't change a single thing. You and your laugh have completed me and fixed everything that's been broken in me and I thank you so much for it. I love you so much.</p>
