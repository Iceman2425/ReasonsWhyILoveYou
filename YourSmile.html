   <h2>Your Smile</h2>
        <p>Babe,
    
    Your smile lights up every room that you walk into.  It has the power to make my day a million times better
    even when I am having the worst day ever.  Your smile is contagious and it makes me smile too.  I love how
    your smile can brighten up my day and make everything feel right in the world.  I love the way your eyes
    sparkle when you smile, and how it makes me feel like I am the luckiest person in the world to be with you.
    Your smile is one of the many reasons why I love you so much.  It is a reflection of your beautiful soul
    and it makes me fall in love with you all over again every time I see it.  I love you, babe, and I am so grateful
    for your smile and everything it represents.  It is a reminder of the love we share and the happiness we bring
    to each other's lives.  I love you more than words can express, and I am so thankful for your smile and the joy it brings
    to my life every day.  You are my sunshine, and your smile is the light that brightens up my world.  I love you so much babe.
